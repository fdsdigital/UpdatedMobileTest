            <p class="cite">C&C is a cute Lil store, the restaurant located on Normandy in the Westside Plaza.
              They cater to American and Filipino dishes. On Saturday evenings they have Karaoke/dancing. It's a cute Lil place located in the corner right next to where Copacabana. If you are looking to book a small party you can call to make a reservation. From time to time they will have an AYCE buffet which is 10. per person. If you don't want the buffet they do have a menu you can order from. It is made fresh to order so it will be nice and hot.
              Karaoke would start from 8 pm till closing.
              Very cozy atmosphere, lots of parking.

            <p class="cite">C&C is great! I wish they had more Filipino offerings on their menu, what they do offer is excellent. Today was Fried rice, beautifully seasoned and with fresh veggies. The Lumpia as usual are some of the best in town. Service is always very friendly and the restaurant is nice and clean.</p>
